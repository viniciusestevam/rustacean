# Rustacean

This project contains my journey through "The book" of rust. :rocket:

### Chapter 1

This chapter is only a introduction to Rust programming language. As this is not my first programming language, I've decided to skip this chapter as they suggest at the Introduction.

### Chapter 2

Here I've learned the basics of Rust by implementing a simple Guessing game. The concepts introduced here was:

- Variable declarations
- Functions
- Standard library and macros
- Basic of pattern matching using `match`
- Usage of external crates and `cargo`
