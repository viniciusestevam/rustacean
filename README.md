# Rustacean :crab:

This project contains my journey through "The book" of rust. :rocket:

### Chapter 1

This chapter is only a introduction to Rust programming language. As this is not my first programming language, I've decided to skip this chapter as they suggest at the Introduction.

### Chapter 2

Here I've learned the basics of Rust by implementing a simple Guessing game. The concepts introduced here was:

- Variable declarations
- Functions
- Standard library and macros
- Basic of pattern matching using `match`
- Usage of external crates and `cargo`

### Chapter 3

In this chapter I've learned the base structures of the Rust programming language, such as:

- Scalar and compound data types
- Functions and the difference between expressions and statements
- Control flow (`if` statements)
- Loops

**Mini projects:**

- [Temperature converter](./chapter-3/projects/temperature-converter) (°F <-> °C)
- [Fibonacci Sequence](./chapter-3/projects/fibonacci)

### Chapter 4

Here is where things started to be really special. This chapter covered the concept of **Ownership**, Borrowing and Slices.
**Ownership** is the way that Rust gives us the control over the memory usage of our programs, but also deals with the automatic clean up of the data when the owner goes out of scope.

As it is a more teorical chapter, there is no pratical projects in it, just a brief example of [slices usage](./chapter-4/slices).
